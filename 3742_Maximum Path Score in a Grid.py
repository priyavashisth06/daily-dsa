'''
3742. Maximum Path Score in a Grid

You are given an m x n grid where each cell contains one of the values 0, 1, or 2. You are also given an integer k.

You start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and want to reach the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1) by moving only right or down.

Each cell contributes a specific score and incurs an associated cost, according to their cell values:

• 0: adds 0 to your score and costs 0.
• 1: adds 1 to your score and costs 1.
• 2: adds 2 to your score and costs 1.
Return the maximum score achievable without exceeding a total cost of k, or -1 if no valid path exists.

Note: If you reach the last cell but the total cost exceeds k, the path is invalid.

 

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0, 1],[2, 0]], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:

The optimal path is:

Cell	grid[i][j]	Score	Total
Score	Cost	Total
Cost
(0, 0)	0	0	0	0	0
(1, 0)	2	2	2	1	1
(1, 1)	0	0	2	0	1
Thus, the maximum possible score is 2.



Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0, 1],[1, 2]], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no path that reaches cell (1, 1) without exceeding cost k. Thus, the answer is -1.

 

Constraints:
• 1 <= m, n <= 200
• 0 <= k <= 103
• grid[0][0] == 0
• 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
